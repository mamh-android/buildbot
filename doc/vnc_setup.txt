1. Ask each user (for example, user name is "myvnc") to set its vnc password by the following command:
	# vncpasswd

2. Configure vnc server for such user by adding the following in the /etc/sysconfig/vncservers file.
	VNCSERVERS="num:myvnc"
	VNCSERVERARGS[num]="-geometry 1600x1200"
Note: num is a different number other than other users.

The final vncservers file should be like:
	VNCSERVERS="1:vncuser1 2:vncuser2 3:vncuser3"
	VNCSERVERARGS[1]="-geometry 640x480"
	VNCSERVERARGS[2]="-geometry 800x600"
	VNCSERVERARGS[3]="-geometry 1600x1200"

3. Also ask user to configure its own config file in ~/.vnc/xstartup to uncomment the following two lines:
	unset SESSION_MANAGER
	exec /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc

4. Restart VNC server by:
	service vncserver restart
